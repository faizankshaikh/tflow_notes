# Tensorflow notes

### Define TF

* Official def

      TF is an opensource software library for numerical computation using dataflow graphs. Nodes in the graph represents mathematical operations, while graph edges represent multi-dimensional data arrays (aka tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API.
      
* Mein def
    * [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) with a twist. (viz graph based)
    * Pre-compile instead of runtime.
  
* Important Points to note
    * tflow had more stars the first day than sklearn had alltime
    * Alltime top 50 starred repos
    * numerous collaborators
    * imp points to cover
        * IO
        * tf graphs
        * run graph, sessions
        * save vars and train models
        * visualize models
        * distributed
    * tflow gif
    * why tflow
        * operates on tensors
        * using flow graph
        * intuitive construct
        * train on cpu/gpu or distributed
        * run wherever, mobile server PC
    * imp funcs to know
    * usual way to write tflow code
    * tf libs
        * tflearn/skflow
        * tf slim
        * tf models
        * tf playground
