# Tensorflow notes

### Define TF

* Official def

      TF is an opensource software library for numerical computation using dataflow graphs. Nodes in the graph represents mathematical operations, while graph edges represent multi-dimensional data arrays (aka tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API.
      
* Mein def
  * [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) with a twist. (viz graph based)
  * Pre-compile instead of runtime.
